## Implementation approach

We will use Python's tkinter library for creating the interactive desktop background. The Pygame library will be used for detecting mouse movements and translating them into drawings or writings. For the chalkboard aesthetic, we will use the PIL (Python Imaging Library) to create a chalk-like effect. The shelve module will be used for saving and loading the user's work.

## File list

- main.py
- chalkboard.py
- drawing.py
- saving.py

## Data structures and interfaces


classDiagram
    class Main {
        -Chalkboard chalkboard
        +main() str
    }
    class Chalkboard {
        -Drawing drawing
        -Saving saving
        +create_chalkboard()
        +detect_mouse_movements()
    }
    class Drawing {
        +draw()
        +erase()
    }
    class Saving {
        +save()
        +load()
    }
    Main --> Chalkboard
    Chalkboard --> Drawing
    Chalkboard --> Saving


## Program call flow


sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant C as Chalkboard
    participant D as Drawing
    participant S as Saving
    M->>C: create_chalkboard()
    C->>D: draw()
    C->>D: erase()
    C->>S: save()
    C->>S: load()
    D-->>C: return drawing
    S-->>C: return saved work
    C-->>M: return chalkboard


## Anything UNCLEAR

Clarification needed on how to handle desktop icons and other standard desktop features within this interactive background. Also, the specific design and functionality of the erasing and saving options need to be clarified.
