This involves creating an interactive interface that can detect mouse movements and translate them into drawings or writings on the desktop background. Additionally, the interface should be visually appealing and user-friendly, resembling a chalkboard and providing options for erasing and saving the user's work.","Requirement Pool":[["P0","Create an interactive desktop background that detects mouse movements"],["P0","Translate mouse movements into drawings or writings on the desktop background"],["P1","Design a user-friendly interface that resembles a chalkboard"],["P1","Provide options for erasing and saving the user's work"]],"UI Design draft":"The UI should resemble a chalkboard, with the desktop icons appearing as if they were drawn or written on the chalkboard. When the user clicks and drags their mouse, it should create a chalk-like effect on the background. There should be an easily accessible toolbar for erasing and saving the user's work.","Anything UNCLEAR":"The specific design and functionality of the erasing and saving options need to be clarified. Additionally, the handling of desktop icons and other standard desktop features within this interactive background is not specified."}
